# AQI Index Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Air Quality Index (AQI) data across different years, states, and urban areas in India to understand pollution severity, identify high-risk regions, and determine the most dominant pollutants.

This dashboard aims to support data-driven environmental awareness and decision-making by presenting AQI trends, pollutant distribution, and regional comparisons in an interactive and visual manner.

## Problem Statement
Air pollution has become a major environmental and public health concern in India. However:
- AQI data is scattered and difficult to interpret for non-technical users.
- There is a lack of comparative insights across cities, states, and time periods.
- Identifying critical pollution hotspots and dominant pollutants is challenging without visualization.

This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw AQI data into meaningful, interactive insights using Power BI.

## Data Visualization & Insights
### 1. Overall AQI Indicator (Gauge)
- Displays current AQI value for the selected filters.
- Example: Delhi AQI ≈ 208, categorized as Very Unhealthy.
- Highlights:
  - Maximum AQI recorded
  - Primary Pollutant (PM2.5)
  - AQI Category

#### Insight:
Major metropolitan cities consistently fall under Unhealthy to Very Unhealthy categories, indicating severe air quality concerns.

---

### 2. AQI by City (Bar Chart)
- Ranks cities based on AQI levels.
- Cities like Delhi, Hajipur, Gurugram, and Panchkula show alarmingly high AQI values.

#### Insight:
Urban and industrial regions experience significantly higher AQI compared to smaller cities.

---

### 3. AQI by State (Map Visualization)
Interactive map showing AQI intensity across Indian states.
Color-coded markers represent pollution severity.

#### Insight:
Northern and central regions of India exhibit higher AQI concentration, especially during peak pollution periods.

---

## 4. AQI Level Distribution (Donut Chart)
- Shows distribution across AQI categories:
  - Moderate
  - Poor
  - Unhealthy
  - Very Unhealthy
  - Hazardous

#### Insight:
A large proportion of observations fall under Unhealthy and Very Unhealthy, indicating prolonged exposure risks for residents.

---

## 5. Pollutant Occurrence Frequency (Bar Chart)
- Displays frequency of pollutants such as:
  - PM2.5
  - PM10
  - O₃
  - NO₂
  - CO

#### Insight:
PM2.5 is the most dominant pollutant, making it the primary contributor to poor air quality across regions.

---

### Interactive Filters Used
The dashboard includes dynamic filters for:
- Year – Analyze AQI trends over time
- State – Compare pollution levels across regions
- Area / City – Drill down into city-level AQI data

#### Benefit:
These filters allow users to perform custom, focused analysis and gain deeper insights instantly.

## Conclusion
The AQI Index Analysis Dashboard effectively transforms complex air quality data into clear, actionable insights. Key conclusions include:
- Air quality in major Indian cities remains consistently unhealthy.
- PM2.5 is the most critical pollutant affecting AQI.
- Northern and metropolitan regions face higher pollution risks.
- Interactive filtering enhances usability and decision-making.

This project demonstrates the power of data visualization, analytical thinking, and Power BI storytelling, making it highly relevant for environmental analysis and public policy insights.
